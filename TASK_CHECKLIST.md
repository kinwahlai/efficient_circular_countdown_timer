## 3. Visual Representation
- [ ] Draw circular progress arc (FR2.1)
- [ ] Support reverse animation direction (FR2.1)
- [ ] Draw background ring (FR2.2)
- [ ] Centered timer text (FR2.3)
- [ ] Configurable text formatting (FR2.4)

## 4. Customization

- [ ] Write widget tests for UI and animation (NFR2.2)
- [ ] (Optional) Write integration tests (NFR2.3)
- [ ] Achieve >90% unit test and >80% widget test coverage (SM2, SM3)

## 8. Documentation & Example
- [ ] Add doc comments for all public APIs (NFR4.2)
- [ ] Provide comprehensive example in /example (NFR4.3)
- [ ] Document API usage and customization in README (NFR4.1, NFR4.2)

## 9. Accessibility
